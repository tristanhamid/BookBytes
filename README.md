**Byte sized book review**  

For me, reading is a great way to keep growing in my field while still enjoying some personal downtime. 
Here is a place I will leave a review for all books computer science and cybersecurity - be it fiction or non-fiction.

Each book review shall be written to the following guidelines:  

  
### [Book Title] by [Author]

3. Apply Knowledge - Ways I can apply or relate this knowledge to work, personal projects, life
4. Rating out of 100 - from an 8 bit binary scale
